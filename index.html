		<div>Black and WhiteConventional and cost-efficient, black and white printing is ideal for text-based content without colorful elements. Publications with black and white art, such as sketches and noir photography, can be equally as captivating as its hued counterparts.


Premium ColorFor an added layer of depth, using full color can make pages pop. Ideal for textbooks, magazines, and other art-heavy works, we use CMYK colors that are high in quality and brightness. For special projects, we’re even able to print with a hexachrome process for an expanded color gamut.
