		<div>Black and WhiteConventional and cost-efficient, black and white printing is ideal for text-based content without colored content. Some publications with black and white arts, such as sketches and noir photography, can be equally as captivating as color.


High-Quality ColorFor an added layer of depth, using full color can make pages pop. Ideal for textbooks, magazines, and other art-heavy works, we use CMYK colors that are high in quality and brightness. For special projects, we’re even able to print with a hexachrome process for an expanded color gamut.
</div>
		<div>Add special finishes to customize the project. With embossment, for example, we are able to carve, stamp, or mold the cover for a multilayer finish. Other finish options include UV spotting, foil stamping, debossing, and die-cutting for an artistic cover.

		<div>For print publishing, there are numerous printing and material options to achieve the ideal finished product. For digital publishing, the reader’s device and software often defines the file format. For either choices, we offer guidance and complete services to publish in print or in digital formats.
</div>
		<div>For even more special projects, we can design an entire experience from the packaging to supplemental materials.
